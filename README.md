# Coins detection

This program has been created as part of Pozna≈Ñ Univercity of Technology project. The algorithm is detecting shapes of coins on input image and trying to classify them based on coin color and ratio to other samples on the photo. 

This algorithm could detect polish coins with the nominal of:
  1) 1gr
  2) 2gr
  3) 5gr
  4) 10gr
  5) 20gr
  6) 50gr
  7) 1zl
  8) 2zl
  9) 5zl

To run this algorithm with samples clone this repository and install next python packages: `skimage matplotlib numpy scipy`. Next you have to run `python3 project.py` command inside the project directory.
If you want to choose difficulty, change argument of the main function in `project.py`.
